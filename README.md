# **Module11-UFOs**
## **JavaScript, Bootstrap, HTML**

## **Overview of the Project**

### The purpose of the project is to create a web page using JavaScript and HTML, that allows users to apply multiple filter criterias of UFO sightings occurences at the same time.  Users will be able to filter the table on date, city, state, country, and shape.
 
## **Results**

### When users open up the UFO sightings website, they will see the introduction section showing the title, background image, and a short article about UFO sightings.  Below it there is a table containing the data and next to the table are five different filters that users can choose: Date, City, State, Country, and Shape.  A single or multiple filters can be entered at the same time to further inspect the data and narrow down the results.  To use the filters, users can simply type in the criteria, e.g. city and state name and press enter.  To remove filtered criterias and see the whole table's data, users can just refresh the website.

## **Summary**

### The new UFO Sighting website lets users to input more filter criterias and narrow down the search to find more specific result in comparison to previous website, which only allows filtering by date.

### One major drawback is that the webpage is not mobile-responsive.  When it was tested using the Toggle Device Toolbar to view the page using various mobile devices, the devices were not able to show the full screen of the page like on a computer.

### Two additional recommendations for further development of the website:

###     1. Adding a reset button to reset the filters and show all the data.  A reset button will make the page look more user friendly as the button will make it easier     for user to understand how to reset the page just by clicking the reset button          instead of refreshing the page because not every one would know how to reset the data without clear instruction.

###     2. Make the website to be mobile-responsive so users can access the page using their mobile phones and tablets.
